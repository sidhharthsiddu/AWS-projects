[200~Project Title: Setup of a Personal VPC with NAT Gateway on AWS
Objective: To create a secure and isolated network environment on AWS with controlled internet access using a NAT gateway.
Technologies Used:
â€¢	Amazon VPC
â€¢	NAT Gateway
â€¢	Internet Gateway
â€¢	Subnets (Public and Private)
â€¢	Route Tables
â€¢	Security Groups
Description:
As part of my learning experience with AWS, I designed and set up a personal Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a NAT gateway to manage internet access for instances in private subnets.
Key Responsibilities:
â€¢	VPC Creation:
o	Created a custom VPC to provide an isolated network environment with specific CIDR block allocation.
â€¢	Subnet Configuration:
o	Configured both public and private subnets within the VPC, organizing resources based on their need for internet access.
â€¢	Internet and NAT Gateway Setup:
o	Set up an Internet Gateway to enable internet connectivity for instances in the public subnet.
o	Deployed a NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound internet traffic securely.
â€¢	Route Tables Management:
o	Configured route tables to direct traffic between the subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway, ensuring proper routing of data.
â€¢	Security Groups and NACLs:
o	Implemented Security Groups and Network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic, enhancing the security of the VPC.
Outcome:
Successfully created a personal VPC with a NAT gateway, demonstrating a solid understanding of networking concepts in AWS. This project helped me gain hands-on experience in designing secure and scalable network architectures.
